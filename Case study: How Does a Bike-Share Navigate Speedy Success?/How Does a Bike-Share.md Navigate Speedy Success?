# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Scenario
As a data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing team, I'm tasked with maximizing annual memberships. To achieve this, I'll analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on these insights, we'll design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into loyal annual members. Our recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional visualizations.

## Business Task
Analyze usage patterns between casual riders and annual members.
Design a marketing strategy to encourage casual riders to become annual members.

## Data Sources
Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip public data for the last 2023 year. Total records: over 5 million.

## Purpose and Context
I'm diving into this dataset to uncover trends, identify anomalies, and prepare the data for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning Techniques Used
1. **Data Validation:**
   - Checked for missing values and ensured data consistency.
   - Validated timestamp formats.
2. **Data Screening:**
   - Examined trip duration outliers (e.g., rides lasting over 24 hours or less than 1 minute).
   - Investigated unusually high or low bike usage counts.
3. **Data Diagnosing:**
   - Explored inconsistencies in station names (typos, variations).
   - Detected duplicate records based on ride IDs.
4. **De-duplication:**
   - Removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
5. **Handling Invalid Data:**
   - Flagged records with negative trip durations.
6. **Addressing Outliers:**
   - Capped trip durations at 24 hours.
   - Removed rides with extreme start/end coordinates.

## Workflow and Steps
1. **Data Loading:**
   - Loaded raw data from CSV files into MySQL using MySQL Workbench.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Cleaned timestamp formats and converted them to datetime objects.
   - Validated ride IDs and station names.
   - Created new features (e.g., day of the week, season).
3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.
   - Highlighted key insights for stakeholders.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Inconsistent Station Names:**
  - Solution: Created a mapping dictionary to standardize station names.
- **Negative Trip Durations:**
  - Solution: Investigated and corrected data entry errors.

## Data Exclusions
- Excluded records with incomplete information (e.g., missing start/end stations).
- Removed outliers beyond reasonable trip durations.

## Summary
In this project, I explored usage trends for Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company. By analyzing over 5 million records, I discovered the following key findings:

1. **User Types:**
   - Non-members (casual riders) constitute 25% of total ridership.
   - Casual riders tend to take longer trips (average 21 minutes) compared to members (average 12 minutes).

2. **Activity Patterns:**
   - Non-members are more active on Fridays and weekends, suggesting potential tourists.
   - They often pick up bikes in touristic areas.

3. **Bike Preferences:**
   - Casual riders prefer docked bikes for longer rides over standard and electric ones.
   - Electric bikes are less popular among both groups, with riders usually completing shorter rides (less than 20 minutes).

4. **Seasonal Trends:**
   - The highest number of rides occurs during summer and fall.
   - Winter experiences the lowest ridership for both member and casual categories.

## Membership Promotion:
- Encourage non-members to become members by offering incentives such as discounted rates for the first month or free trial periods.
- Highlight the benefits of membership, such as shorter wait times, priority access to bikes, and exclusive offers.

## Tourist Engagement:
- Since non-members are often active on weekends and in tourist areas, consider targeted marketing campaigns for tourists.
- Collaborate with local tourism boards or hotels to promote bike-sharing as an eco-friendly way to explore the city.

## Bike Distribution Optimization:
- Allocate more bikes to popular tourist spots during weekends.
- Ensure a balanced distribution of standard and electric bikes based on user preferences.

## User Experience Enhancement:
- Improve the bike pickup and return process. Consider adding more stations in high-traffic areas.
- Provide real-time availability information through a mobile app or website.

## Data-Driven Decision Making:
- Continue monitoring usage patterns and adjust strategies accordingly.
- Explore additional data sources (e.g., weather, events) to enhance insights.

## Seasonal Preparedness:
- **Summer and Fall:** These seasons see the highest ridership. Ensure bike availability, maintenance, and customer support during peak times.
- **Winter:** While ridership is lower, maintain essential services and monitor any seasonal fluctuations.
